I'm another person trying to learn this program. My name is Egami. 
Fun Fact: I'm actually editing some of this on my phone right now (5/30/2023). 

- **Why did I decide to learn this?**: I needed to learn something new. I also was tired of software, plugins or games that I desired not existing. So I decided I should try learning how to make the stuff I want myself. 
- **What do I want to build first?**: The first thing I really want to build is a plugin or plugins for a minecraft server my friend asked me to work on.
- **Do you even know what you're doing?**: LMFAO. Hell no. I just got here.

**Course tips:**

* Glossary terms will be _emphasised_ and linked to their definition.

## How to start this course

<!-- For start course, run in JavaScript:
'https://github.com/new?' + new URLSearchParams({
  template_owner: 'skills',

1. Right-click **Start course** and open the link in a new tab.
2. In the new tab, most of the prompts will automatically fill in for you.
   - For owner, choose your personal account or an organization to host the repository.
   - We recommend creating a public repository, as private repositories will [use Actions minutes](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-actions/about-billing-for-github-actions).
   - Scroll down and click the **Create repository** button at the bottom of the form.
3. After your new repository is created, wait about 20 seconds, then refresh the page. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the new repository's README.
