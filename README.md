<summary><h2>Egami</h2></summary>

I'm another person trying to learn this program. My name is Egami. 
Fun Fact: I'm actually editing some of this on my phone right now (5/30/2023). 

- **Why did I decide to learn this?**: I needed to learn something new. I also was tired of software, plugins or games that I desired not existing. So I decided I should try learning how to make the stuff I want myself. 
- **What do I want to build first?**: The first thing I really want to build is a plugin or plugins for a minecraft server my friend asked me to work on.
- **Do you even know what you're doing?**: LMFAO. Hell no. I just got here.

_Shit I actually did myself :wave:_


**I made my first repository

**I made my first branch

**I submitted my first pull request

**I completed my first merge

**I created my first personal repository 

**I made a ReadMe.md and started editing it

6. Move on to Step 2!

   **Note**: If you made a public repository, and want to confirm you correctly set up your first branch, wait about 20 seconds then refresh this page (the one you're following instructions from). [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) will automatically close this step and open the next one.

<summary><h2>Current Small Goals</h2></summary>

_You created a branch! :tada:_

Creating a branch allows you to edit your project without changing the `main` branch. Now that you have a branch, it’s time to create a file and make your first commit!

**What is a commit?**: A _[commit](https://docs.github.com/pull-requests/committing-changes-to-your-project/creating-and-editing-commits/about-commits)_ is a set of changes to the files and folders in your project. A commit exists in a branch. For more information, see "[About commits](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/committing-changes-to-your-project/creating-and-editing-commits/about-commits)".

### :keyboard: Activity: Your first commit

The following steps will guide you through the process of committing a change on GitHub. A commit records changes in renaming, changing content within, creating a new file, and any other changes made to your project. For this exercise, committing a change requires first adding a new file to your new branch.

1. On the **< > Code** tab in the header menu of your repository, make sure you're on your new branch `my-first-branch`.

2. Select the **Add file** drop-down and click **Create new file**.

   ![create new file option](/images/create-new-file.png)

3. In the **Name your file...** field, enter `PROFILE.md`.

   **Note:** `.md` is a file extension that creates a Markdown file. You can learn more about Markdown by visiting "[Basic writing and formatting syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)" in our docs or by taking the "[Communicating using Markdown](https://github.com/skills/communicate-using-markdown)" Skills course.

4. In the **Edit new file** area, copy the following content to your file:

   ```
   Welcome to my GitHub profile!
   ```

   <img alt="profile.md file screenshot" src="/images/my-profile-file.png"/>

5. For commits, you can enter a short commit message that describes what changes you made. This message helps others know what's included in your commit. GitHub offers a simple default message, but let's change it slightly for practice. First, enter `Add PROFILE.md` in the first text-entry field below **Commit new file** at the bottom of the page. Then, if you want to confirm what your screen should look like, expand the dropdown below.

   <details>
   <summary> Expand to see the screenshot.</summary>
   <img alt="screenshot of adding a new file with a commit message" src="/images/commit-full-screen.png" />
   </details>

6. In this lesson, we'll ignore the other fields and click **Commit new file**.
7. Move on to Step 3!

   **Note**: Like before, you can wait about 20 seconds, then refresh this page (the one you're following instructions from) and [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) will automatically close this step and open the next one.

<!--
  <<< Author notes: Step 3 >>>
  Just a historic note: the previous version of this step forced the learner
  to write a pull request description,
  checked that `main` was the receiving branch,
  and that the file was named correctly.
-->

<details id=3>
<summary><h2>Step 3: Open a pull request</h2></summary>

_Nice work making that commit! :sparkles:_

Now that you have made a change to the project and created a commit, it’s time to share your proposed change through a pull request!

**What is a pull request?**: Collaboration happens on a _[pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-glossary#pull-request)_. The pull request shows the changes in your branch to other people and allows people to accept, reject, or suggest additional changes to your branch. In a side by side comparison, this pull request is going to keep the changes you just made on your branch and propose applying them to the `main` project branch. For more information about pull requests, see "[About pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)".

### :keyboard: Activity: Create a pull request

You may have noticed after your commit that a message displayed indicating your recent push to your branch and providing a button that says **Compare & pull request**.

![screenshot of message and button](/images/compare-and-pull-request.png)

To create a pull request automatically, click **Compare & pull request**, and then skip to step 6 below. If you don't click the button, the instructions below walk you through manually setting up the pull request.

1. Click on the **Pull requests** tab in the header menu of your repository.
2. Click **New pull request**.
3. In the **base:** dropdown, make sure **main** is selected.
4. Select the **compare:** dropdown, and click `my-first-branch`.

   <img alt="screenshot showing both branch selections" src="/images/pull-request-branches.png" />

5. Click **Create pull request**.
6. Enter a title for your pull request. By default, the title will automatically be the name of your branch. For this exercise, let's edit the field to say `Add my first file`.
7. The next field helps you provide a description of the changes you made. Here, you can add a description of what you’ve accomplished so far. As a reminder, you have: created a new branch, created a file, and made a commit.

   <img alt="screenshot showing pull request" src="/images/Pull-request-description.png" />

8. Click **Create pull request**. You will automatically be navigated to your new pull request.
9. Move on to Step 4!

   **Note**: Like before, you can wait about 20 seconds, then refresh this page (the one you're following instructions from) and [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) will automatically close this step and open the next one. As a perk, you may see evidence of GitHub Actions running on the tab with the pull request opened! The image below shows a line you might see on your pull request after the Action finishes running.

   <img alt="screenshot of an example of an actions line" src="/images/Actions-to-step-4.png"/>

<!--
  <<< Author notes: Step 4 >>>
  Just a historic note: The previous version of this step required responding
  to a pull request review before merging. The previous version also handled
  if users accidentally closed without merging.
-->

<details id=4>
<summary><h2>Step 4: Merge your pull request</h2></summary>

_Nicely done! :sunglasses:_

You successfully created a pull request. You can now merge your pull request.

**What is a merge?**: A _[merge](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-glossary#merge)_ adds the changes in your pull request and branch into the `main` branch. For more information about merges, see "[Merging a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/incorporating-changes-from-a-pull-request/merging-a-pull-request)."

As noted in the previous step, you may have seen evidence of GitHub Actions running which automatically progresses your instructions to the next step. You'll have to wait for it to finish before you can merge your pull request. It will be ready when the merge pull request button is green.

![screenshot of green merge pull request button](/images/Green-merge-pull-request.png)

### :keyboard: Activity: Merge the pull request

1. Click **Merge pull request**.
2. Click **Confirm merge**.
3. Once your branch has been merged, you don't need it anymore. To delete this branch, click **Delete branch**.

   <img alt="screenshot showing delete branch button" src="/images/delete-branch.png"/>

4. Check out the **Finish** step to see what you can learn next!

   **Note**: Like before, you can wait about 20 seconds, then refresh this page (the one you're following instructions from) and [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) will automatically close this step and open the next one.
