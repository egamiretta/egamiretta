# About Me

_I'm praticing coding through GitHub. This is my first time doing this._

I'm another person trying to learn this program. My name is Egami. 
Fun Fact: I'm actually editing some of this on my phone right now (5/30/2023). 

- **Why did I decide to learn this?**: I needed to learn something new. I also was tired of software, plugins or games that I desired not existing. So I decided I should try learning how to make the stuff I want myself. 
- **What do I want to build first?**: The first thing I really want to build is a plugin or plugins for a minecraft server my friend asked me to work on.
- **Do you even know what you're doing?**: LMFAO. Hell no. I just got here.

**Course tips:**

* Glossary terms will be _emphasised_ and linked to their definition.

## How to start this course

<!-- For start course, run in JavaScript:
'https://github.com/new?' + new URLSearchParams({
  template_owner: 'skills',
  template_name: 'introduction-to-github',
  owner: '@me',
  name: 'skills-introduction-to-github',
  description: 'My clone repository',
  visibility: 'public',
}).toString()
-->

[![start-course](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1221423/235727646-4a590299-ffe5-480d-8cd5-8194ea184546.svg)](https://github.com/new?template_owner=skills&template_name=introduction-to-github&owner=%40me&name=skills-introduction-to-github&description=My+clone+repository&visibility=public)

1. Right-click **Start course** and open the link in a new tab.
2. In the new tab, most of the prompts will automatically fill in for you.
   - For owner, choose your personal account or an organization to host the repository.
   - We recommend creating a public repository, as private repositories will [use Actions minutes](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-actions/about-billing-for-github-actions).
   - Scroll down and click the **Create repository** button at the bottom of the form.
3. After your new repository is created, wait about 20 seconds, then refresh the page. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the new repository's README.

_Shit I actually did myself :wave:_


**I made my first repository

**I made my first branch

**I submitted my first pull request

**I completed my first merge

**I created my first personal repository 

**I made a ReadMe.md and started editing it

6. Move on to Step 2!

   **Note**: If you made a public repository, and want to confirm you correctly set up your first branch, wait about 20 seconds then refresh this page (the one you're following instructions from). [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) will automatically close this step and open the next one.

_You created a branch! :tada:_

Creating a branch allows you to edit your project without changing the `main` branch. Now that you have a branch, itâ€™s time to create a file and make your first commit!

**What is a commit?**: A _[commit](https://docs.github.com/pull-requests/committing-changes-to-your-project/creating-and-editing-commits/about-commits)_ is a set of changes to the files and folders in your project. A commit exists in a branch. For more information, see "[About commits](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/committing-changes-to-your-project/creating-and-editing-commits/about-commits)".

### :keyboard: Activity: Your first commit

The following steps will guide you through the process of committing a change on GitHub. A commit records changes in renaming, changing content within, creating a new file, and any other changes made to your project. For this exercise, committing a change requires first adding a new file to your new branch.

1. On the **< > Code** tab in the header menu of your repository, make sure you're on your new branch `my-first-branch`.

2. Select the **Add file** drop-down and click **Create new file**.

   ![create new file option](/images/create-new-file.png)

3. In the **Name your file...** field, enter `PROFILE.md`.

   **Note:** `.md` is a file extension that creates a Markdown file. You can learn more about Markdown by visiting "[Basic writing and formatting syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)" in our docs or by taking the "[Communicating using Markdown](https://github.com/skills/communicate-using-markdown)" Skills course.

4. In the **Edit new file** area, copy the following content to your file:

   ```
   Welcome to my GitHub profile!
   ```

   <img alt="profile.md file screenshot" src="/images/my-profile-file.png"/>

5. For commits, you can enter a short commit message that describes what changes you made. This message helps others know what's included in your commit. GitHub offers a simple default message, but let's change it slightly for practice. First, enter `Add PROFILE.md` in the first text-entry field below **Commit new file** at the bottom of the page. Then, if you want to confirm what your screen should look like, expand the dropdown below.
