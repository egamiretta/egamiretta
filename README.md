<h3>A little bit about me</h3>

I'm another person trying to learn this program. My name is Egami. 
Fun Fact: I'm actually editing some of this on my phone right now (5/30/2023). 

- **Why did I decide to learn this?**: I needed to learn something new. I also was tired of software, plugins or games that I desired not existing. So I decided I should try learning how to make the stuff I want myself. 
- **What do I want to build first?**: The first thing I really want to build is a plugin or plugins for a minecraft server my friend asked me to work on.
- **Do you even know what you're doing?**: LMFAO. Hell no. I just got here.
